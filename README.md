# LeLe-Pop-star
In my 54 years I have listened to all kinds of music from A to Z. I have always loved music. I know that if you are reading this you, too, are a music lover. Music is sublime, mechanical, and mathematical in its complexity. Those who can write music and perform what they write are truly talented individuals. They see ideas in their minds and turn them into sound for the rest of us to enjoy. Le Le is one of those glorious individuals who can do just that. Le Le is a pop artist. Her music is, of course, danceable but it also has a message. “Money Whore” is about the dog eat dog world we live in and the people who prostitute their morality and replace it with the desire for money, money, money. It is a shame there are so many rip off artists in the music industry who go with this philosophy and use the excuse, “ That is just the way it is, we have to make that money and getting ripped off is just part of the business for you newcomers. In spite of these rip off artists in the music industry, Le Le is overcoming these obstacles. Her latest Video,” Power”, is about overcoming the negative and turning that negative into a positive by exercising your personal power and never giving up until you win the game we all have to play in life. These are just two examples of Le le’s, Amanda McCauley by birth, philosophical outlook on life and how we should all conduct ourselves in life. Be kind and fair to everyone and beware of the crooks because they are out there. Amanda writes from her heart and is quickly gaining popularity in the Detroit Music Scene. She has also performed in LA and Texas. Her show the other night was amazing. Her voice is powerful and the messages resonate with young people of all races and creeds because they are universal. Many young people, certainly those struggling with life appreciate her experiences and identify with the feelings expressed. Le Le is very much loved by everyone she works with. Her style and swagger are indicative of her desire to make it in a world dominated by excess and greed; conspicuous consumption and the need to keep up with the Joneses even to personal ruin. We all want the things we THINK we can’t have so we take shortcuts to our own detriment. Le Le, through her music and message, tells us we can have those things but we need to work at it and watch after ourselves because no one else will. Watch out for this young lady from Detroit, Michigan. The name is Le Le and she will be a household name before too long and will bring you as much joy as she brings me.
